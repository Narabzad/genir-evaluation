1115210	Chaff and flare are defensive measures used in military aviation to counter the threat of radar-guided or heat-seeking missiles. Chaff is composed of small pieces of reflective material, often aluminum or metallized glass fibers, which are ejected from an aircraft to confuse radar signals. When released, chaff creates a cloud of reflections that either hides the aircraft or creates multiple false targets, making it difficult for radar to track the actual aircraft. Flare, on the other hand, is used to counter heat-seeking missiles. These are essentially pyrotechnic devices that produce a bright light and intense heat, aiming to decoy the infrared homing systems of a missile. The missile is tricked into following the flare instead of the aircraft.

141630	Muscles and bones work together to produce movement through a system known as the musculoskeletal system. The bones provide the structure and the muscles provide the power. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on a bone. Because muscles are attached to bones via tendons, when they contract, the bone is pulled along with it, creating movement. This is often described as a lever system. For example, if you want to lift your arm, your brain sends a signal to the muscles in your arm to contract. The contracting muscles pull on your arm bones, causing your arm to lift. The joints between bones allow for flexibility and range of motion. Different types of joints allow for different types of movement. For example, the hinge joint in your elbow allows for bending and straightening, while the ball and socket joint in your shoulder allows for a wider range of motion. So, in summary, muscles and bones work together to produce movement by using the muscles as the force to move the bones at their joints.
